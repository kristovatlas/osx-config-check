# osx-config-check

Checks your OSX machine against various hardened configuration settings.

You can specify your own preferred configuration baseline by supplying your own [Hjson](https://hjson.org/) file instead of the provided one.

## Disclaimer

The authors of this tool are not responsible if running it breaks stuff; disabling features of your operating system and applications may disrupt normal functionality.

Once applied, the security configurations do not not guarantee security. You will still need to make good decisions in order to stay secure. The configurations will generally not help you if your computer has been previously compromised.

Configurations come from sites like:

## Usage

**You should download and run this application once for each OS X user account you have on your machine.** Each user may be configured differently, and so each should be audited.

Download this app using Git, GitHub Desktop, or the "download as zip" option offered by GitHub. If you choose the zip option, unarchive the zip file after.

In the `Terminal` application, navigate to the directory that contains this app. You can use the `cd` command (see example below) to change directories. If you've downloaded the file to your "Downloads" directory, you might find the app here:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/osx-config-check
```

If that directory doesn't exist because the folder you retrieved is named slightly different (such as 'osx-config-check-master' or 'osx-config-check-1.0.0'), you can always type in a portion of the directory name and hit the [TAB] key in Terminal to auto-complete the rest.

Next run the app as follows:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will take you through a series of interactive steps that checks your machine's configuration, and offers to fix misconfigurations for you.

Intermediate users and advanced users can also invoke various command-line arguments:
```
Usage: python app.py [OPTIONS]
OPTIONS:
	--debug-print        Enables verbose output for debugging the tool.
	--report-only        Only reports on compliance and does not offer to fix broken configurations.
	--disable-logs       Refrain from creating a log file with the results.
	--disable-prompt     Refrain from prompting user before applying fixes.
	--skip-sudo-checks   Do not perform checks that require sudo privileges.
	--help -h            Print this usage information.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Errors related to "sudo" or "sudoers"

If you receive an error message referencing these terms, the user you are currently logged in as may not be permitted to temporarily assume elevated privileges, preventing this tool from fully auditing and/or fixing your user's configuration. If you have added a non-Administrator user to your machine to help secure it, you will find that your non-Administrator user is not part of the "sudoers" list by default. To learn about how to add your user to the "sudoers" list, please [refer to this link](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/06/add-user-sudoers-file-mac/).

### Trouble Connecting to Wi-Fi

This tool encourages users to use DNS servers run by the Google corporation. This can break some wi-fi networks that use "active portals" to login, like those found at cafes, airports, etc. If you're having trouble connecting to a wi-fi network after using this tool, please use the "dns_helper" tool included. From the terminal application, run:

    bash dns_helper.sh

And follow the instructions on the screen carefully.

### Something in OS X broke!

A few users have observed that features like screen saver activation with hot corners stopped working after applying configuration fixes. These problems have so far been remedied simply by restarting the system.
