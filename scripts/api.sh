# Description: Contains functions that serve as an API for osx-config-check and
# which maximize code reuse of bash script.
# All functions added to this file should be simple and easy to review for
# security.

# Other bash scripts can use these functions by sourcing this file and invoking
# the functions as if they were commands. Example:
# source ./scripts/api.sh ; if [ $(homebrew_is_installed) = "1" ] ; then echo "pass" ; else echo "fail" ; fi
# OR
# source ./scripts/api.sh ; echo $(homebrew_is_installed)
